        					<h2>Description</h2>
    					</header>
    					<p>Welcome to “Things Game,” a fun and unique board game created by Tonghe Zhuang, a postdoctoral researcher in computational cognitive neuroscience from Hebart’s lab. Our lab focuses on understanding how we effortlessly recognize objects, people, and places in our complex visual world. To learn more about our research, you can visit our lab’s website: <a href="https://hebartlab.com/" target="_blank">Hebart Lab</a>.</p>

        				<h2>Why this game was created</h2>
    					</header>
    					<p>Initially, the game was designed for our PI’s birthday in 2024. While searching for a gift, we realized that there are few games available in our field, and the existing ones often need to be ordered online—a time-consuming and inconvenient process. To address this, “Things Game” was created as a free, print-and-play board game, based on one of our core experimental paradigms, “Odd One Out.”</p>

        				<h2>The Story behind the game</h2>
    					</header>
    					<p>'Let's select gifts for our PIs'<br />
    						'Yes, let's do it'<br />
    					'How about xxx? or xxx, or xxxxx?' <br />
    							-----thousands years later-----<br />
    								'The birthday is next week, but we have nothing!'<br />
    									'We could order a board game for him. Although it won't arrive on time, we can give him a card: WILL BE ARRIVED SOON.'<br />
    								''<br />
    								'How about a memory card? but no idea about how it works'<br />
    								------------LAB MEETING------------------<br />
    								'Hi, MH, we are going to talk about the journal club, and it is not relevant to you. You could leave to save time.'<br />
    								MH: 'I can stay and contribute.''<br />
    							'No, Thank you.'<br />
    						MH: Clear!<br />
    								'I combined the idea of a board game and a memory card, and then created a new board game based on our lab!'<br />
    							-----LAB teamwork finished in few minutes----<br />
    							ALL: Brainstorm for the name!<br />
    							Laure: Selected 110 images from dataset in 5 min! <br />

# Game Components:

## Cards:
Thing Cards: Each card represents an object, concept, or entity (e.g., tree, airplane, etc.).
Target Cards: A special set of cards that represent target "Things" chosen by players.

## Objective:
The goal is to be the first player to get rid of all your Thing Cards by successfully matching them to a target card based on group agreement or identifying cards that do not fit in a given set.

## Set-up:
1.	Shuffle the Thing Cards and deal a set number to each player (e.g., 5 or 7 cards).
2.	Place the some cards in a separte pile for drawing during the game.
3.	Target Cards in a separate pile.
4.	Select the first player (e.g., the youngest player, or by rolling a die).
## Game Mechanics:
You can choose one of the following methods or play both as separate rounds.

# Method 1: Match the Target (Inspired by Uno)
## Start the Round:
A Target Card is drawn and placed face-up in the center. This card represents a thing that players must match.
Playing Cards:

On each turn, players must play a Thing Card from their hand that they believe is "similar" to the Target Card. Players must justify their choice (e.g., “This card is similar to the target because both are natural elements”).
[hard mode: the first player limites the dimension of the similarity, such as ‘color’.]

## Setup: 8 cards/ player

## Group Agreement:
After a player places their card, the group votes on whether the card is a valid match.

If the group agrees: The card is accepted, and play moves to the next player.

If the group disagrees: The player must draw a new card from the pile and keep the card they tried to play. Then, move to another target card.

# Failure to Justify:
If a player cannot explain why their card fits the set, they must draw another card.

## Winning:
The first player to get rid of all their cards wins the game.
 
# Method 2: Eliminate the Odd One Out
## Starting the Round:
The first player places a Target Card face-up in the center.

The same player then places one Thing Card from their hand as the first item in the group.

## Building the Set:
Each player takes turns placing a Thing Card from their hand, trying to add cards that seem to fit the set based on similarity to the Target Card and the other cards played.

If 3-5 players: 8-10 cards/ player

If more than 5 players: 5 cards/ player 

## Eliminating the Odd One:
Once all players have placed a card, the group decides which card in the set does not fit (the "odd one out"). If the group unanimously agrees on the odd card:

If 3-5 players: The player who placed that card must draw a new card.

If more than 5 players: all players except the player who placed that card must draw a new card.

## Disagreement:
If the group cannot agree on the odd card. All people have to draw a new card.

## Winning:
The first player to get rid of all their cards wins.

 
### Additional Rules:
1.	Tie-breaking Mechanism

2.	In case of a tie during group voting (for either agreement on similarity or deciding the odd one out), the player to the left of the player whose card is in question gets to make the final decision.

For a longer game, play multiple rounds and track points for each win. The player with the most points at the end wins overall.

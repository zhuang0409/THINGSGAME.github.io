Computational Cognitive Neuroscience game

Designer: Tonghe Zhuang

## Description
Welcome to "Things Game," a fun and unique board game created by Tonghe Zhuang, a postdoctoral researcher in computational cognitive neuroscience from Hebart's lab. Our lab focuses on understanding how we effortlessly recognize objects, people, and places in our complex visual world.

## Why This Game Was Created
Initially, the game was designed for our PI's birthday in 2024. While searching for a gift, we realized that there are few games available in our field, and the existing ones often need to be ordered online—a time-consuming and inconvenient process. To address this, "Things Game" was created as a free, print-and-play board game, based on one of our core experimental paradigms, "Odd One Out."

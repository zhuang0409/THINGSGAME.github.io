            <h1><strong style="color: black;">Game Rules</strong></h1>
                <p>There are three different ways to play the board game: <em><strong style="color: black;">Simple Way, Group Way, and Family Way</strong></em>, designed to suit different types of players.</p>

                <h3><em><strong style="color: blue;"> Simple Way: Match the Target (Inspired by Uno)</em></strong></h3>

                <h4><strong style="color: black;">Objective:</h4></strong>
                <p>Be the first player to get rid of all your cards by successfully identifying the "odd one out" in each round.</p>
				<h4><strong style="color: black;">Setup: Each player starts with 8 cards.</h4>
				<h4><strong style="color: black;">Starting the Round:</h4></strong>
                <p>Draw a Target Card and place it face-up in the center. This card represents an item that players must match.<br>
               
                <h4><strong style="color: black;">Playing Cards:</h4></strong>
                <li>On each turn, players must play a Thing Card from their hand that they believe is "similar" to the Target Card. Players must justify their choice (e.g., "This card is similar to the target because both are natural elements").</li>
                <li>Players must justify their choice (e.g., "This card is similar to the target because both are natural elements").</li>
                <li>[hard mode: the first player limits the dimension/categories of the similarity, such as 'color' or animal. More categories/dimensions, you could find from <a href="https://github.com/zhuang0409">this paper</a>, such as Table 1]</li></p>

                <h4><strong style="color: black;">Group Agreement:</h4></strong>
                <p>After a player places their card, the group votes on whether the card is a valid match.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the group agrees: The card is accepted, and play moves to the next player.</li>
                    <li>If the group disagrees: The player must draw a new card from the pile and keep the card they tried to play. Then, move to another target card.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><strong style="color: black;">Failure to Justify:</h4></strong>
                <p>If a player cannot explain why their card fits the set, they must draw another card.</p>

                <h4><strong style="color: black;">Winning:</h4></strong>
                <p>The first player to get rid of all their cards wins the game.</p>

                <h3><strong style="color: blue;"><em>Group Way: Eliminate the Odd One Out</h3></em></strong>
                <h4><strong style="color: black;">Objective:</h4></strong>
				<p>Be the first player to get rid of all your cards by successfully identifying the "odd one out" in each round.</p>

                <h4><strong style="color: black;">Setup:</h4></strong>
                <li>Each player gets 5 Thing Cards.</li>
                <li>Create a Target Card deck with 10-15 cards.</li>
                <li>Set aside a draw pile for the Thing Cards.</li>
                <li>Shuffle all decks before starting.</li>
                <ul>
                
                </ul>
                <h4><strong style="color: black;">How to Play:</h4></strong>
                <p><strong style="color: black;"> 1. Starting the Round:</p></strong>
                	<li> The first player draws a Target Card and places it face-up in the center.</li>
                    <li> That same player plays one Thing Card from their hand as the first item in the group.</li>
                <ul>
                </ul>  
				<p><strong style="color: black;"> 2. Building the Set:</p></strong>
					<li> Each subsequent player takes turns adding one Thing Card from their hand to the set.</li>
                    <li> Players aim to add cards that are distinct from the Target Card and each other.</li>
                    <li> Continue until all players have played a card. Shuffle these cards and then face up.</li>
                <ul>
                </ul> 
                <p><strong style="color: black;"> 3. Eliminating the Odd One:</p></strong>
                	<li> After all cards are placed, the group decides which card is the "odd one out". </li> 
                	<li> If the group unanimously agrees, the starter chooses who placed the odd card. If they guess correctly, they can discard one of their cards. The player who placed the odd card must take their card back and draw a new one.If they guess incorrectly, they must draw a new card. </li> 
                	<li> All except the starters and person who placed the odd card have to take the card back and draw a new card.</li> 
                	<li>If the group cannot agree on the odd card, all players must draw a new card.</li>
				<ul>
                
                </ul>
                <h4><strong style="color: black;">Winning:</h4></strong>
                <li>The first player to get rid of all their cards wins.</li>
                <li>If the Target Card deck runs out, the player with the fewest cards left wins.</li>
				<ul>
                
                </ul>
				<h3><em><strong style="color: blue;"> Family Way: Eliminate the Odd One Out</h3></em></strong>

                <h4><strong style="color: black;">Set up:</h4></strong>
                <li>8 cards/player</li>
                <li>A Target card pile with 10-15 cards </li>
                <li>A separate pile for drawing during the game</li>
                <li>Each player (except the first player) takes turns placing a Thing Card from their hand, trying to add cards that seem to fit the set based on similarity to the Target Card and the other cards played.</li>             
                <li>Shuffle the cards first and then face up.
                <ul>
                <h4><strong style="color: black;">Starting the Round:</h4></strong>
                <p>The first player places a Target Card face-up in the center. The same player then places one Thing Card with face-up from hand as the first item in the group.</p>

                </ul>
                <h4><strong style="color: black;">Eliminating the Odd One:</h4></strong>
                <p>Once all players have placed a card, the group decides which card in the set does not fit (the "odd one out"). If the group unanimously agrees on the odd card:</p>
                	<li> All players except the player who placed that card must draw a new card.</li>

                <li> If the group cannot agree on the odd card, all players must draw a new card.</li> 
                <ul>
                </ul>

                <h4><strong style="color: black;">Winning:</h4></strong>
                <p>The first player to get rid of all their cards wins or the player who has the least cards in their hands will win when running out the target cards.</p>

                <h3>Additional Rules:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Tie-breaking Mechanism:</strong> In case of a tie during group voting (for either agreement on similarity or deciding the odd one out), the player to the left of the player whose card is in question gets to make the final decision.</li>
                    <li>For a longer game, play multiple rounds and track points for each win. The player with the most points at the end wins overall.</li>
                </ol>
